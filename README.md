# **Retro Game Collection üïπÔ∏è**

A curated collection of classic and puzzle mini-games built with a retro-inspired aesthetic using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project brings together several fun, challenging games into a single, polished web application.

## **Games Included**

This collection features a variety of games to test your logic, memory, and strategy:

* **Lights Out 5x5:** A classic puzzle where the goal is to turn all the lights off. Clicking a light toggles it and its adjacent neighbors. Includes a "Solve" feature\!  
* **Magic Square:** A logic puzzle where you must turn on all the outer lights using specific button presses.  
* **Tic-Tac-Toe:** The timeless game of X's and O's. Play against another person or a much-improved AI that will actively block and try to win. A line is drawn to show the winning combination.  
* **Echo:** A memory game similar to Simon. Watch the sequence of lights and repeat it back. The sequence gets longer with each level.  
* **Wordle:** Guess the secret 5-letter word in six tries or less, with feedback given for each guess. Now features a full on-screen keyboard for better mobile play.  
* **Blackjack 21:** A robust card game where the goal is to get as close to a score of 21 as possible without going over. Features **smart aces** that automatically count as 1 or 11 for the best hand.  
* **Slider Puzzle:** A classic 8-puzzle where you must slide the tiles to arrange them in numerical order. Includes a handy "Shuffle" button to restart the puzzle anytime.  
* **Minefield:** A version of Minesweeper. Clear the board without detonating any hidden mines. Now with a "chord" feature: right-click a revealed number to quickly clear its neighbors if the correct number of flags are placed.  
* **Connect AI:** Try to get four of your colored discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the AI does.  
* **Line Draw:** A flow-style puzzle game. Connect the matching colored dots without crossing the paths.
